# Code-to-YouTube-Shorts-Video-Generator

# Project Overview
This project is a Python-based tool that transforms code files into visually engaging video snippets, specifically optimized for YouTube Shorts. By focusing on the 9:16 portrait aspect ratio, it’s designed to help developers, educators, and content creators quickly generate video content that fits seamlessly into YouTube’s Shorts format. The tool supports syntax highlighting, allows custom frame settings, and has a user-friendly interface built with PySide6.
